# PriceWin for Pi

Live hotel and flight prices compared across Booking.com, Agoda, Trip.com and
Traveloka, in USD, from inside [Pi](https://pi.dev). The package adds:

- **`extensions/pricewin.ts`**: registers the PriceWin MCP server,
  `https://mcp.price.win/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, no account, no API key). Pi
  packages cannot carry an `mcp.json`, so this one-call extension does it;
- **`skills/pricewin-travel-search`**: how to run a search (results arrive in
  two steps), what to ask when the trip details are incomplete, and how to read
  prices and links.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@pricewin/pi
```

or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/PriceDotWin/pricewin-pi
```

Then ask, for example:

> Compare hotel prices in Da Nang for 2 adults from November 10 to 12.

`/mcp` lists `pricewin` with the extension as its source. The tools are named
`mcp__pricewin__<tool>` and use Pi's default `codemode` exposure. To change
that, or to point at another URL, add a `pricewin` entry to
`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`; a file entry takes precedence over the extension.

Tested with Pi 1.0.0.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_hotels_live`, `poll_search_results` | Search a city's hotels across the OTAs and OpenTravel partner hotels; results arrive in two steps |
| `search_flights_live`, `poll_flight_results` | Search one-way or per-leg round-trip fares |
| `get_ota_hotel_detail` | Rooms, live prices, facilities and reviews for one named hotel (Booking.com) |
| `get_hotel_detail`, `get_hotel_info` | Rooms and prices, or facilities and policies, of an OpenTravel partner hotel |
| `get_cancellation_policy` | Refund terms for one rate |
| `request_booking`, `check_booking_status` | Send a booking request to a partner hotel and read its status |
| `request_cancel_token`, `cancel_booking` | Cancel such a booking, in two steps |

**Booking takes no money.** `request_booking` sends the guest's name, phone and
email to the hotel, which confirms the request; no room is held and the guest
pays at the property. Cancelling needs a single-use token that is emailed to the
address on the booking, so nothing is cancelled without the guest's own inbox.

## What the package sends, and where

The extension makes no network call itself; it tells Pi where the server is.
Pi then talks to one remote MCP server, `https://mcp.price.win/mcp`.

- **To `mcp.price.win`**: the arguments of each tool call, which are trip details
  (city, dates, party size, hotel name, price range, airports, cabin), a short
  excerpt of the request used only to pick the reply language, and, for a
  booking request, the guest's name, phone number and email.
- **Onward from PriceWin's server**: only to PriceWin's own backend and to
  OpenTravel's API (`api.travelopen.ai`), which the PriceWin developer also owns.
  A booking request's name, phone and email go to the partner hotel through
  OpenTravel, so the hotel can confirm it.
- **Usage analytics**: PriceWin records trip parameters only (city, dates,
  party size, hotel name, currency), never a guest's name, email, phone,
  confirmation code or cancel token.
- **Where prices come from**: PriceWin's backend reads Booking.com, Agoda,
  Traveloka, Trip.com and Google Flights from their public pages at search time.
  PriceWin has no partnership with those sites. Each result is labelled with its
  source and links to it for booking. Prices are time-sensitive.

No payment data is ever requested. See the
[privacy policy](https://www.price.win/en/privacy-policy) and
[terms of service](https://www.price.win/en/terms-of-service).

The same server and skill are packaged for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Antigravity
and OpenCode in
[pricewin-agent-plugin](https://github.com/PriceDotWin/pricewin-agent-plugin).
